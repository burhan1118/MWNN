# Multi-modal Weighted Nearest Neighbors

This is a python implementation of [Weighted Nearest Neighbors](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.12.335331v1) with some added features. I did my best to reimplement the method in the pre-print but keep in mind that the original method may change from now and and the final publication, that may create some discrepencies.

## Differences between MWNN and WNN
* Support for an arbitrary number of modalities, at the moment WNN supports only [two](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/3693)
* Possibility to radius nearest neighbors instead of KNN
